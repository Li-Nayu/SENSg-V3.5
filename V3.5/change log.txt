Schematic:
1.Changed Micro USB B
2.Changed the position of LDR and R12£¬add pull-up resistor R20.

pin1 voltage: [R12 & R20 are tested]
condition                       value
total darkness               around 3.0V
normal condition          2.5V
with phone's flashlight around  2.0V
MOSFET S output
in any condition above 
<=0.3V

3.Add P-channel Mosfet
4.Changed Camera's 3.3V port, named it MOSFET_CONTROL

ERC & DRC check
